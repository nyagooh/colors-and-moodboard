# Atomic Design Components

Welcome to the **Atomic Design Components** section of the UI repository! This folder contains a collection of reusable UI components structured according to the Atomic Design methodology.

## What is Atomic Design?

Atomic Design is a methodology for creating design systems by breaking down user interfaces into their fundamental building blocks. It consists of five distinct levels:

1. **Atoms**: Basic HTML elements like buttons, inputs, and labels.
2. **Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms functioning together as a unit, such as a form label paired with an input.
3. **Organisms**: Complex components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms, forming distinct sections of an interface.
4. **Templates**: Page-level structures that place components into a layout, providing context for the organisms.
5. **Pages**: Specific instances of templates, populated with real content to represent the final UI.

## Folder Structure

This folder is organized to reflect the Atomic Design principles:

- **Atoms/**: Contains the foundational UI elements.
- **Molecules/**: Houses components made up of multiple atoms.
- **Organisms/**: Includes complex UI components formed by combining molecules and atoms.
- **Templates/**: Provides layout structures that arrange organisms into a cohesive design.
- **Pages/**: Demonstrates specific instances of templates with real content.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nyagooh/UI.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Atomic Design Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd UI/atomic\ design
   ```

3. **Explore Components**:
   - Browse through the folders to understand how each component is constructed.
   - Utilize these components in your projects to maintain consistency and reusability.

4. **Integrate into Your Project**:
   - Import the necessary components into your project files.
   - Customize them as needed to fit your design requirements.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new components or improve existing ones:
